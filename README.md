# Cracking the Code Interview 6th Edition: Ruby Solutions (In Progress)

Here are my solutions with `RSpec` testing for each of the problems in the book,
`Cracking the Code Interview (6th Edition)` by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

Since all of these problems can be done multiple ways, all of these problems will only contain one solution. It might not be the most optimal, but these are the solutions that make the most sense for me. I'd love to hear
better Ruby solutions out there.

* Going to pick and choose questions throughout the book
